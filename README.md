my first godot game! barebones of a side-scrolling platformer built for daydream jumpstart from hack club.

small platformer that takes you through the streets of downtown madison (accurate representation of my morning commute btw) where you have to navigate the perils of madison life, mainly bicycles and beer scattred haphazardly throughout the streets. collect the cheese because we're cheeseheads and reach the capitol at the end to gift your cheese to governor tony evers as a "campaign contribution"

use WASD or arrow keys to control. 

Disclaimer: AI was likely used in the generation of the assets as they look quite AI-generated. Background music also generated by Suno.AI as i do not have time to compose music. sorry :( i regret using clankers for this project :(
