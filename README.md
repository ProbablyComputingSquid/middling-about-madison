this is my first godot game! barebones of a side-scrolling platformer built for daydream jumpstart from hack club.

small platformer that takes you through the streets of downtown madison (accurate representation of my morning commute btw) where you have to navigate the perils of madison life, mainly bicycles and beer scattred haphazardly throughout the streets. collect the cheese because we're cheeseheads and reach the capitol at the end to gift your cheese to governor tony evers as a "campaign contribution"

use WASD or arrow keys to control. 

Disclaimer: AI was likely used in the generation of the assets as they look quite AI-generated. Background music also generated by Suno.AI as i do not have time to compose music. sorry :( i regret using clankers for this project :(

## how was this made? 

all the level design and code and such was made in godot 4 (not .NET) on linux. sadly, i didn't have the time or skills to create my own sprites or music, so i had to return to clanker art and music. one of the greatest regrets of this project, i could have done better. someday i will learn how to draw good and my projects will be so much better!! but all of the code and design otherwise has been produced by ME and only ME! no clankers in my gdscript codebase

## why was this made?

this was made for the daydream jumpstart event that was supposed to get landyards and badges for the daydream organizers, but since my daydream ended up getting canceled, i never got anything for it and just had a game on my hands that i had sunk 9 hours into. 

## struggles and challenges

ugh i suck so much at level design, all the level design here is so buns, i tried watching youtube videos on level design and it didn't help at all especially when i just had a couple basic blocks, i probably could have spent more time and added more complex blocks, but sooo much of the time spent was trying to make good levels instead of writing code and implementing new features. i also struggled to understand the godot user interface but after some time i began to get the hang of it!
